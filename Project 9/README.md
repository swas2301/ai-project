# Image Classification using Deep Learning
Classifying Covid-19 positive and negative patients from X-ray images<br><br>
<b>About the Project:</b> The outbreak of COVID-19 has had an immense impact on world health and daily life in many countries. The first imaging procedure that played an important role in COVID-19 treatment was the chest X-ray. Radiological imaging is often used as a method that emphasizes the performance of chest X-rays. Recent findings indicate the presence of COVID-19 infections in the patients with irregular findings on chest X-rays. There are many reports on this topic that include machine learning strategies for the identification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays.<br><br>
This project uses radiological imaging to determine whether the scanned patient has COVID-19 or not.<br><br>
